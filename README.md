============

<h3>Foundation 4 for Joomla 3</h3>

<p>SiegeEngine2 is the long overdue update to SiegeEngine, a responsive template framework for Joomla built on Foundation4</p>
<p>Based on Zurb's excellent Foundation4 framework, and using some simple but robust PHP and a lot of things learned from the previous incarnation, SiegeEngine2 aims to be fast and flexible to use.</p>
<p>As always, Foundation is untouched, so you can update it to your heart's content as Zurb release updates. All of the Joomla specific styling is located in our SiegeEngine.css file so you always know where to look.</p>
