<h3>Foundation 4 for Joomla 3</h3>

<p>SiegeEngine2 is the long overdue update to SiegeEngine, a responsive template framework for Joomla built on Foundation4</p>
<p>Based on Zurb's excellent Foundation4 framework, and using some simple but robust PHP and a lot of things learned from the previous incarnation, SiegeEngine2 aims to be fast and flexible to use.</p>
<p>As always, Foundation is untouched, so you can update it to your heart's content as Zurb release updates. All of the Joomla specific styling is located in our SiegeEngine.css file so you always know where to look.</p>

<p>For more info, some basic documentation and a working demo, head over to <strong><a href="http://www.siegeengine.org/" alt="Foundation4 for Joomla3" title="SiegeEngine - Foundation4 template for Joomla">http://www.siegeengine.org/</a><strong></p>

<hr/>
<h5>Known issues</h5>
<ul>
<li>Top Bar Title field in template settings doesn't do anything - yet!</li>
<li>"Sections" module layouts work, but only one per page as they interfere with each other :/</li>
<li>No off-canvas - yet</li>

</ul>
<p>As always, we're continuing to work on this and with your feedback, hope to keep improving it!</p>
